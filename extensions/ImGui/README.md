# egnx-imgui-ext
Sync from https://github.com/Xrysnow/cocos2d-x-imgui and do a little changes

## How to use
Same with https://github.com/Xrysnow/cocos2d-x-imgui but do a little changes:
* ```CCIMGUI``` --> ```cocos2d::extension::ImGuiEXT```
* ```ImGuiLayer``` --> ```cocos2d::extension::ImGuiLayer```
* And no lua bindings currently
